generations:
  - name: "First Generation (SM)"
    start_year: 2000
    end_year: 2006
    description: "The original Hyundai Santa Fe was the brand's first SUV, representing an important entry into the growing segment. Featuring somewhat awkward but distinctive styling with oversized wheel arches and unusual headlight arrangements, it was built on a car-based platform rather than the truck-based approach common for SUVs of that era. Available with a range of four-cylinder and V6 engines depending on the market, with the 2.7L V6 being the most common in North America. Offered with front-wheel drive or an optional all-wheel drive system, it positioned itself as a value alternative to established competitors like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4, though slightly larger. The interior was basic but practical, focusing on durability rather than luxury. This generation established the Santa Fe nameplate and helped build Hyundai's reputation in the SUV market, offering impressive content for its price point despite some refinement shortcomings."

  - name: "Second Generation (CM)"
    start_year: 2006
    end_year: 2012
    description: "The second-generation Santa Fe featured more conventional styling with improved proportions and a higher-quality appearance both inside and out. Slightly larger than its predecessor, it was available in both short-wheelbase five-passenger and long-wheelbase seven-passenger configurations in some markets. Engine options evolved to include more refined and powerful units, typically including a 2.4L four-cylinder and 3.5L V6 in North America, with various diesel options in other markets. The interior saw significant improvements in design, materials, and features, reflecting Hyundai's overall push upmarket during this period. Safety features expanded to include stability control, six airbags, and active head restraints as standard equipment. This generation elevated the Santa Fe's position in the market, offering a more refined and competitive product that helped establish Hyundai as a serious contender in the midsize crossover segment."

  - name: "Third Generation (DM)"
    start_year: 2012
    end_year: 2018
    description: "The third-generation Santa Fe adopted Hyundai's 'Fluidic Sculpture' design language, featuring more dynamic styling with bold character lines and the brand's signature hexagonal grille. Available in two distinct versions: the five-passenger Santa Fe Sport (shorter wheelbase) and the seven-passenger Santa Fe (longer wheelbase, eventually renamed Santa Fe XL in North America). Engine options varied by market but typically included a 2.4L four-cylinder and 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder for the Sport, with a 3.3L V6 for the longer version, plus diesel options in some regions. The interior featured a significant upgrade in design, materials, and technology, offering near-luxury appointments in higher trims. Safety technology advanced with the introduction of features like blind-spot detection, rear cross-traffic alert, and lane change assist. This generation further established the Santa Fe as one of Hyundai's core models globally, competing effectively with established midsize crossovers while maintaining a value advantage."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (TM)"
    start_year: 2018
    end_year: 2024
    description: "The fourth-generation Santa Fe featured more muscular styling with a bold front fascia incorporating split headlight design (a theme that would influence other Hyundai SUVs). Now offered exclusively in one wheelbase length as a five-passenger vehicle (with the three-row role taken by the larger Palisade), it grew slightly in overall dimensions for improved interior space. Engine options evolved to focus on efficiency, with a 2.4L four-cylinder base engine and 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder optional in North America, plus the addition of hybrid and plug-in hybrid variants in later model years. The interior represented a major step forward with a more premium design, higher-quality materials, and advanced technology including an available 10.25-inch touchscreen, digital instrument cluster, and head-up display. Safety features expanded significantly with Hyundai's comprehensive SmartSense suite including forward collision avoidance, blind-spot collision avoidance, and Highway Driving Assist. A significant facelift in 2021 substantially updated the styling with an even bolder grille and new lighting signature. This generation elevated the Santa Fe to a near-premium position in Hyundai's lineup, offering sophisticated styling, technology, and refinement while maintaining the brand's value proposition."

  - name: "Fifth Generation"
    start_year: 2023
    end_year: null
    description: "The current Santa Fe features a radical redesign with a boxy, upright silhouette that contrasts dramatically with its more rounded predecessor. Drawing inspiration from Land Rover and classic SUVs, it features a squared-off profile with an H-shaped lighting signature, prominent body cladding, and a more traditional SUV stance rather than the crossover styling of previous generations. Built on Hyundai's latest platform, it's slightly larger than the outgoing model with a significant focus on interior space and versatility. Engine options vary by market but center around a 2.5L four-cylinder in naturally aspirated and turbocharged forms, plus hybrid and plug-in hybrid powertrains combining a 1.6L turbocharged engine with electric motors. The interior represents a complete reinvention with a horizontal dashboard design featuring dual 12.3-inch screens, a bridge-type center console, and numerous practical storage solutions. Available with six or seven-seat configurations, it introduces unique features like fold-flat second-row seats that create a fully flat floor from the tailgate to the front seats, enhancing its utility for outdoor activities. Technology has advanced to include Hyundai's latest connectivity, assistance, and safety systems, including available features like Remote Smart Parking Assist and Digital Key 2. This generation repositions the Santa Fe as a more adventure-focused vehicle with greater emphasis on versatility and outdoor lifestyle use, while maintaining the refinement and technology expected in a modern crossover."
