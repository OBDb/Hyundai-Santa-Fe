## Generations

The Hyundai Santa Fe has evolved through five distinct generations since its introduction in 2000, progressing from Hyundai's first SUV to a sophisticated mid-size crossover with advanced technology and electrified powertrains:

- **First Generation (2000-2006)**: Introduced in 2000 as Hyundai's inaugural SUV entry and launched for the 2001 model year, the Santa Fe marked a milestone in the company's expansion into the SUV segment. Initially positioned as a compact crossover, it featured a rugged yet refined design with a 2.4L four-cylinder engine (standard) or a 2.7L V6 engine (optional), both available with either a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. The first generation emphasized practicality with spacious interior accommodations for five passengers and generous cargo space. In 2003, Hyundai upgraded the model with more powerful engine options and a computer-controlled four-wheel drive system. The vehicle received a comprehensive facelift for 2005 with revised grille, updated tail lights, redesigned rear bumper, and an improved instrument cluster, maintaining its appeal until production ended in 2006.

- **Second Generation (2006-2012)**: Unveiled at the 2006 North American International Auto Show and arriving for the 2007 model year, the second generation represented a significant step upward in size and refinement. After Hyundai introduced the smaller Tucson in 2004, the Santa Fe was repositioned as a mid-size crossover. The redesigned model featured more conservative, bio-design-influenced styling with swept-back headlights and curved surfaces. It launched with two V6 engine options: a 2.7L producing 185 hp with choice of 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission, and a 3.3L generating 242 hp with a 5-speed automatic. Optional three-row seating accommodated up to seven passengers. The Santa Fe received a substantial mid-cycle refresh for 2010, introducing new powertrains including a fuel-efficient 175 hp 2.4L four-cylinder and a more powerful 276 hp 3.5L V6, all paired with a new six-speed automatic transmission (the 2.4L FWD retained a manual option). The facelift also brought an updated grille with horizontal and vertical gridded bars (now body-colored instead of black), new all-red tail lights with chrome detailing, revised 5-spoke alloy wheels, and enhanced interior features including Bluetooth connectivity and touch-screen navigation.

- **Third Generation (2012-2018)**: Launched at the 2012 New York International Auto Show for the 2013 model year, the third generation introduced a two-variant strategy with both short and long wheelbases. The short-wheelbase version was marketed as the Santa Fe Sport in North America (two-row, five-passenger configuration) while simply called Santa Fe in other markets where three-row seating was standard or optional. The long-wheelbase model was called Santa Fe in the U.S. and Santa Fe XL in Canada, offering three rows and six or seven passenger seating. Both featured Hyundai's "Storm Edge" design language with a distinctive hexagonal grille and more sculpted body lines. The manual transmission was eliminated. Engine options included a 190 hp 2.4L four-cylinder, a new 264 hp 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder, and a 290 hp 3.3L V6 (replacing the previous 3.5L), all with six-speed automatic transmissions. By 2016, the short-wheelbase version had dropped the four-cylinder engines. A comprehensive facelift arrived for 2016, changing approximately 350 parts (about 25% of the vehicle). Updates included a radically redesigned front fascia with lower-mounted fog lamps, new horizontal LED daytime running lights, HID Xenon headlights with LED accents, restyled rear bumper, updated taillights, and an enhanced interior with a revised instrument panel and available 12-speaker Infinity Logic7 sound system with Android Auto compatibility.

- **Fourth Generation (2018-2023)**: Introduced in February 2018 in South Korea and at the Geneva Motor Show in March, arriving in North America for the 2019 model year, the fourth generation represented a significant shift in strategy. The short-wheelbase, two-row model (previously Santa Fe Sport) became simply the Santa Fe, while the long-wheelbase three-row variant was renamed Santa Fe XL. The new Santa Fe featured a more aggressive design with narrow headlights and a distinctive wide hexagonal grille with mesh insert. The vehicle grew longer by 80mm and wider by 10mm with a 65mm longer wheelbase compared to its predecessor. Power came from either a 185 hp 2.4L four-cylinder or a 235 hp 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder, both paired with a new eight-speed automatic transmission. The fourth generation introduced extensive use of high-tensile strength steel (57% of body structure) for improved safety and rigidity. A substantial facelift arrived for 2020 (marking the Santa Fe's 20th anniversary), bringing distinctive T-shaped LED daytime running lights, a wider cascading grille with 3D pattern, revised rear styling with full-width reflective strip, redesigned bumpers, and a modernized interior featuring a shift-by-wire push-button gear selector, 10.25-inch touchscreen, and 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster. The facelift was built on an updated N3 platform enabling the introduction of hybrid and plug-in hybrid powertrain options, featuring a 1.6L turbocharged hybrid system with 231 hp combined output.

- **Fifth Generation (2024-present)**: Unveiled in August 2023 and launched for the 2024 model year, the fifth generation brought a revolutionary redesign with a bold, boxy silhouette representing a dramatic departure from previous generations. The new design features a distinctive upright stance with H-shaped LED lighting elements, a wide vertical grille, and pronounced fender flares, creating a more rugged and commanding presence. Standard three-row seating returns across all trim levels, with the longer wheelbase (110.8 inches) and overall length (190.2 inches) providing improved passenger space and cargo capacity (up to 80 cubic feet maximum). The model offers two powertrain options: a 277 hp 2.5L turbocharged four-cylinder with an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission (changed to conventional eight-speed automatic for 2026 model year), and a 1.6L turbocharged hybrid system producing 231 hp combined output with a six-speed automatic transmission. Both powertrains are available with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. The interior features a curved panoramic display combining a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster with a 12.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system, dual-hinged center console for improved access, and premium materials including available Nappa leather. Advanced features include Over-the-Air (OTA) software updates, enhanced HTRAC all-wheel drive system, and the XRT trim with increased ground clearance, all-terrain tires, and 4,500 lbs towing capacity. The fifth generation represents Hyundai's vision of a modern family SUV that balances rugged capability with sophisticated technology and urban refinement.
